Embedded Systems Class Final Assignment

This Assignment was meant to challenge us to use all of the techniques with MSP430 Assembly Code
that we had learned throughout our time in the class. It has 4 different functions that can be
used: A Memory Change Function, A Hexadecimal to ASCII translator, an Addition Program, and a 
Hexadecimal calculator that can Add and Subtract.

This is meant to be run on a MSP430G2553 board, but it should easily be possible to make it run
on any other board by adjusting the designation at the top of the "main.asm" file.
